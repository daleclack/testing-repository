A testing repository

[Experimental]: After gtk112 and gtk113, the submodule GCR_CMake is imported

Thanks for the project author https://github.com/Makman2/GCR_CMake

(Actually, I forked the project for convenience)

Note: To minimize the repeated files,I put the same files as public resource

The file name is above: public\_res\<filename\>\_\<file extension\> or public\_res\<filename\>\_\<file extension\>

Please compile with g++ or gcc (Clang is also supported)
(Visual Studio may have issues)
